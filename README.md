Sion Train Horn,
A very basic League of Legends mod written by:

Krishan Rajaratnam (NA: YoullTankMeLater, LAN: smurf platano)
Kunal Shah (NA: Down Xindrome)

This mod adds a train horn sound effect to Sion's ult. 

--How To Use--
If on a Mac, just run the 'train' executable (either by just opening ‘train’ in
Finder or using Terminal). You need to be using the NA server 
(needs to be already patched),and you need to have the League of Legends app be in 
your /Applications directory (it probably is). Make sure League is not running.

If you don’t trust running a suspicious-looking executable (understandable), the source code
(main.c) is provided. You can recompile it to another executable if you so wish, but it needs to
be in this directory to work.

If on a Windows, go to the Resources folder and replace the
Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk in the League of Legends English program files with
the one in the Resources folder (under this directory). Unfortunately, recompiling
main.c and running it wont work.

--Uninstalling (reverting to default)--
On Macs, simply run the 'revert' executable (either by opening 'revert' in Finder or in Terminal').
revert.c is provided as the source code and can be recompiled.

For windows users, go into the Resources folder, and then go into the original folder. 
There will be a Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk which contains Sion's default voice-pack.
Replace the Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk in the League of Legends English program files with this.

This mod works on the NA Server, in English. However, you can manually move the 
Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk to substitute in for the voice pack for any champion,
in any language, if you so wish.
