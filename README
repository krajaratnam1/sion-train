Sion Train Horn
A very basic League of Legends mod written by:

Krishan Rajaratnam (NA: YoullTankMeLater, LAN: smurf platano)
Kunal Shah (NA: Down Xindrome)

This mod adds a train horn sound effect to Sion's ult. 

--How To Use--
If on a Mac, just run the executable (either by just opening ‘train’ in
Finder or using Terminal). You need to be using the NA server 
(needs to be already patched),and you need to have the League of Legends app be in 
your /Applications directory (it probably is). Make sure League is not running.

If you don’t trust running a suspicious-looking executable (understandable), the source code
(main.c) is provided. You can recompile it to another executable if you so wish, but it needs to
be in this directory to work.

If on a Windows, go to the Resources folder and replace the
Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk in the League of Legends English program files with
the one in the Resources folder (in this directory). Alternatively, if you
have cygwin (or another UNIX environment) installed, and are a bit savvy, 
you can compile main.c into an executable and run it through cygwin.

NOTE: League of Legends is the property of Riot Games, All audio containing
sounds provided by Riot Games are the Property of Riot Games. We do not

This mod works on the NA Server, in English. However, you can manually move the 
Sion_Base_VO_audio.wpk to substitute in for the voice pack for any champion,
in any language, if you so wish.
